Online privacy concerns focus on the protection of "personally identifiable" information which an individual or customer reasonably expects to be kept private. As the term suggests, "personally identifiable" information is information that can be associated with a specific individual or entity.

Wan Mei will collect and use this information for the ability to provide and change service, to anticipate and resolve problems with your service, for billing purposes, or to create or inform you of products and services that better meet your needs.
